<h2><span style="color:rgb(220,54,54);">What is octave?</span></h2>
GNU Octave is software featuring a high-level programming language,
primarily intended for numerical computations. Octave helps in solving
linear and nonlinear problems numerically, and for performing other
numerical experiments using a language that is mostly compatible with
MATLAB

<h2><span style="color:rgb(220,54,54);">Matrics and Array</span></h2>
Octave is an abbreviation for "matrix laboratory." While other
programming languages mostly work with numbers one at a time, Octave is
designed to operate primarily on whole matrices and arrays.

<h2><span style="color:rgb(220,54,54);">Array Indexing</span></h2>
Every variable in Octave is an array that can hold many numbers. When
you want to access selected elements of an array, use indexing.

<h2><span style="color:rgb(220,54,54);">Workspace Variables</span></h2>
The workspace contains variables that you create within or import into
Octave from data files or other programs. For example, these statements
create variables A and B in the workspace.

<h2><span style="color:rgb(220,54,54);">Character Strings</span></h2>
A character string is a sequence of any number of characters enclosed in
single quotes. You can perform operation on strings such as
concatenation and string conversion etc.

<h2><span style="color:rgb(220,54,54);">Callling Function</span></h2>
Octave provides a large number of functions that perform computational
tasks. Functions are equivalent to subroutines or methods in other
programming languages. Octave functions are ceil, floor, max, min etc.

<h2><span style="color:rgb(220,54,54);">2-D and 3-D Plots</span></h2>
Interpolation is an estimation of a value within two known values in a
sequence of values. Polynomial interpolation is a method of estimating
values between known data points.

---

<h2><span style="color:rgb(220,54,54);">Programming and Scripts</span></h2>
A script is a file with a .m extension that contains multiple sequential
lines of MATLAB commands and function calls. You can run a script by
typing its name at the command line.
